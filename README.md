# summarize-gpt

Summarize GPT is a project through which you can summarise pieces of text!
It uses artificial intelligence in the form of OpenAI's GPT models to provide unique summaries, which are customisable.

## Whats in the project? 

- API through which you can generate summaries with ease
- Great prompt to produce good results from the AI
- Currently a demo inside to guide you on how to use the project

## How to start?

This project does not require money to use ChatGPT, as it uses an API from @acheong08 to get access to the browser
version of chatgpt.

You require a OpenAI session token. This is free, and you can get this from https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session 
while you are logged into your OpenAI account.
Use the demos inside to see how to start. There is also useful comments when hovering over the summarize function, which will
tell you all you need to know on how to use it.

Enjoy! 


## Want to contribute?

Please, make a pull request or a issue if you find something which can be improved. I will be working on this project for a while yet, and will be making
sister projects to it to make this a (hopefully) cool thing.


## Credits

This project would not be possible without the greater 'ChatGPT breaking' community at large. Thanks to them this project exists, and much of the code is made with help and borrowed from people who I have talked to.
